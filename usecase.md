## Blockchain and art forgery

### Pros

* The advantage will be to control art Authority through proven digital solution.

### Contros
* The disadvantage will be that it will work great for digital art, but other
art artifacts (paintings, sculptures etc) will need to first obtain some
kind of digital signature to enter the blockchain network.

### Posssible Application Design
* set of art sellers {Org1, Org2} which are
  connected to the Authority
* each seller is able to "createArt()"
* the member of the Authority can "buyArt()" or "sellArt()"
* only members of {Org1, Org2} can "createArt()"
* only members of the Authority can "buyArt()" or "sellArt()"
